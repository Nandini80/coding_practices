Code reviews in FE
1. No business logic in selector
2. In api.js, directly call api (don't make payload or something) (make it in mutation.js)
3. when there are more than 2 variables, use that in constant not directly
4. use mapToStateProps: when more than one selectors used in jsx file
5. use react hook form: to prevent re-rendering of page, and handle validation efficiently.
6. make use of existing functions rather than making new one
7. use useCallback: when heavy component and re-renders are less, toh give dependencies in which you want to re-render it
8. add isObject and isArray check correctly
9. If 1 line code in a function and it is used only at one place, then instead of making it a function, use that line directly
10. all similar things like useState should be at same place.
11. Don't add unnecessary CSS
12. use ?? instead of ||, since || will return null in case of falsy values or '' etc, but ?? this will return null only when undefined or null
13. use useMemo: when computation is heavy, and computing again and again.
14. don't use useEffect unless needed.
15. do api call in action.js->Sync(describes or triggers something) or mutation.js->Async(calls api or change data) (these are for state management)
16. Self review
